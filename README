 collection of software that interfaces different types of pyrometers to a msp430 uC

 supported devices:
  - pocket Micronix Plus pyrometer (via it's debug interface)
  - Raytek Thermalert MI (via mV output) (not implemented yet)
  - Raytek PM Plus (not implemented yet)

Features:
 - an MSP430F5510 uC for very low quiescent current
 - programming/debug via TI spy-bi-wire
 - uC can activate new readings on the pyrometer
 - decode i2c-like debug output to retrieve remote and reference temperatures
