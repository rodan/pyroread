 collection of software that interfaces different types of pyrometers to a msp430 uC

 supported devices:
  - pocket Micronix Plus pyrometer (via it's debug interface)
  - Raytek Thermalert MI (via mV output) (not implemented yet)
  - Raytek PM Plus (not implemented yet)

 author:       Petre Rodan <petre.rodan@simplex.ro>
 license:      GNU GPLv3

Features:
 - an MSP430F5510 uC for very low quiescent current
 - programming/debug via TI spy-bi-wire
 - uC can activate new readings on the pyrometer
 - decode i2c-like debug output to retrieve remote and reference temperatures

as development hardware a MSP430-5510STK devboard [1] is used for now (*)

Pinout:
 - P1.0 - Micronix Plus CLK
 - P1.1 - Micronix Plus DATA
 - P1.2 - Micronix Plus ACT
 - P4.4 - uart1 TX
 - P4.5 - uart1 RX

Power:
 - 3.7v LiPo

(*) R21, R22, R26, R27, R35, C24, C27, C28 have been removed from the board
